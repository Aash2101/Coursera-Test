				<b>Summary:</b> This visualization shows how the Amur leopard population differs in 2020s as compared to the 1970s. As the image shows, the leopard population has significantly fallen over the years. On hovering over the visualtion, you can also see the ID of the leopard. Under the visualtion, there are reasons for the decrease in the population. These include poaching, habitat loss, prey scarcity, and inbreeding. This visualization shows us that the population of these leopards has gone down from being clusters to mere dots.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Domain:</b> The most likely intended users of this visualization are wildlife enthusiasts, environmental researchers and conservationists,NGOs, and students interested in or concerned about wildlife populations around the world.</li>
				<li><b>Data:</b> 
					<ul>
						<li><b>Domain description:</b> This visualization represents data regarding the population of Amur leopards in the world. It provides insights on population dynamics over time including individual leopards and thier IDs and the various factors resulting in the decrease of population like poaching and habitat loss.</li> 
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Task:</b>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Domain description:</b> The visualization shows the differences in Amur leopard population over time. It also represents the various factors that have led to the depletion of population. This data can be used to reduce the effect that factors like habitat loss, and poaching have on tiger and other wildlife population. </li> 
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Idiom:</b> This visualisation uses a leopard image to illustrate the split-face concept. The leopard population in the 1970s is depicted on the left using the "cluster" visual encoding, where several leopards are gathered together in clusters. indicating a denser population. The population of the 2000s is shown on the right side using a "dot" visual encoding, indicating a more dispersed population. The interaction, which enables users to hover and discover leopard IDs, improves viewer engagement and comprehension of the information.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>Personal Thoughts</b> I found this visualization to be very interesting. As I was scrolling through the website to find a visualization, this was the first one that caught my eye, and upon looking through the details, and its interactive feautures, I thought it was very well implemented. The shape of the visualtization resembles that of a leopard, and it accurately describes the population dynamic over time.
